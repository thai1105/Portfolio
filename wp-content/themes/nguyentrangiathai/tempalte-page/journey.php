                            With a particular interest in recycled fashion, I have studied extensively the literature on the recycled fashion market both in Vietnam and globally. Notably, after partnering with Tuan Dat— a friend who shares the same passion for recycled fashion— we established the start-up Resho:es with the mission of transforming some leftover leather materials from manufacturing workshops into high-quality, durable shoes.

                        <p class="wow fadeInUp">
                            However, throughout the business process, I encountered many difficulties in reaching customers and persuading them to consume this type of product instead of the currently trending footwear products. Learning from other businesses, I proposed implementing promotional programs to stimulate consumption; however, the results were not significant. Thus, I wondered, "Can economic incentives influence consumer purchasing decisions regarding recycled fashion and footwear in Vietnam?" To answer this question, I embarked on this research under the guidance of Dr. Hoang Vu Hiep at the Faculty of Financial Economics, National Economics University (NEU). Dr. Hiep guided me in designing a large-scale survey with 1,023 participants and conducting field experiments at 120 retail stores nationwide.

                                    The research process began with developing the survey questionnaire, focusing on collecting data regarding consumer behavior, awareness of economic incentives, and interest in recycled fashion. After gathering the data, I proceeded with the analysis using appropriate statistical methods. The analysis results showed that economic incentives have a significant impact on consumer purchasing decisions. Specifically, product discounts led to a sales growth of up to 28.3%, while loyalty programs increased the average order value by 31.7%.

                                <p class="wow fadeInUp">
                                    The research findings not only provided insights into consumer behavior but also offered practical recommendations for retailers. I proposed that brands consider incentives such as discounts, reward programs, and communication campaigns to enhance interest and consumption of recycled fashion products. These findings contribute to the efforts to promote sustainable consumption in the fashion industry and create positive changes for the environment.
                                </p>

                                    After conducting this research, I also implemented more appropriate promotional programs for our Resho project. I realized that my previous discount programs were ineffective partly due to insufficient branding and communication strategies to reach potential customers. Following the research, I enhanced our social media presence through participating in fairs at high schools and in the Hanoi area. With positive feedback and promotional discounts, along with attentive customer care, I not only helped shape the recycled shoe brand among young people but also gained over 1,500 followers on our fan page, increasing the project’s revenue by 15% compared to before. While this may not be a huge achievement, I believe it is a solid start for our first start-up.

                            At the end of 8th grade, I began my journey exploring programming at KITE Academy. This was not just a course; it was the starting point that opened the door to the world of technology, where logical thinking and problem-solving skills are formed. At KITE, I had the opportunity to engage with programming languages such as Python, Scratch, and a bit of C++. Each language was like a fresh breeze, providing me with immense motivation to continually learn and develop.

In this role, I was not just a knowledge transmitter but also a guide, helping the students explore and gain a deeper understanding of programming. I taught basic concepts, provided hands-on guidance, and was ready to answer all their questions.
